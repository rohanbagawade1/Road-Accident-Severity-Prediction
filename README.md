# Road-Accident-Severity-Prediction
Final Project for PG-DBDA course using PySpark, Django, Python, Microsoft Azure, Databricks, Azure Data Factory, Pandas, Power BI

# INTRODUCTION

One of the most determined issues today is that of road accidents. It overwhelmingly impacts  people's lives financially, physically, and emotionally. Hundreds of billions of dollars are lost annually due to the economic and social effects of traffic accidents and some major accidents that cause the majority of the damage. The WHO estimates that 1.35 million people are killed and over 50 million are injured annually due to traffic accidents worldwide. Also, data shows that automobile accidents are the leading killer of kids and young adults aged 5 to 29. However, reducing traffic accidents is a huge challenge, especially fatal ones. His preventive method, which is one of the two main ways to make roads safer, works to get rid of dangers before they happen. For this plan to work, it must be possible to predict when accidents will happen and how bad they will be. When we know the causes and common factors that lead to these terrible events, we might be able to take better steps and make better use of our resources.  

Different Machine learning algorithms will be used in this study to come up with a way to predict how bad traffic accidents will be. The main goal of this study is to find out which factors have the biggest effect on how bad an accident is. Second, we need to make models that can accurately predict how bad an accident will be. To be more specific, this model is meant to predict the likelihood of an accident, if it is a severe or not based on factors like severity score, weather conditions, etc. 

Models used in this project:
1.Logistic Regression
2.Decision Tree Classifier
3.Random Forest Classifier
4.XGBoost Random Forest Classifier
5.Gaussian Naive Bayes Classifier
6.K-NN Classifier

# PROBLEM STATEMENT

A thorough examination is needed to address the staggering incidence of traffic accidents in a community. By utilizing various supervised learning approaches, this investigation will be carried out in greater depth to ascertain the severity of the traffic incidents. On an integer rating of 1 to 4, this will categorize the accidents' seriousness. Our ability to assess and lessen the severity of incidents will enable us to lower the number of fatalities and the resulting monetary damages. 


# PROJECT OBJECTIVES 

1.To investigate the causes of the accident by extracting features from the provided inputs.
2.To comprehend the accident's seriousness based on factors like severity score. 
3.To categorize accidents according to the degree of seriousness of the incident using a rating system that ranges from 1 to 4.
4.To apply various machine learning algorithms and determine each one's accuracy and performance.
5.To determine the quickest algorithm.
6.must comprehend how each aspect affected the disaster and determine how much of it was to blame. 
7.Additionally, a web UI should be offered so that estimations may be made and parameters can be calculated.
